# Charge Amps API bindings for Python

This repository contains a Python module for the Charge Amps' electric vehicle charging stations.

The module is developed by [Kirei AB](https://www.kirei.se) and is not supported by [Charge Amps AB](https://chargeamps.com).

## How to use

The simplest way is to install via `pip`, as in:

```

```

If you need access to the organisation API calls, you need to specify this feature upon installation:

```
pip install chargeamps["organisations"]
```
